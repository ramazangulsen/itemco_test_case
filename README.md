### Folder Structure

Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- core/
  |- base_providers/
  |- enums/
  |- helpers/
  |- models/
  |- repositories/
  |- services/
  |- viewmodels/
|- l10n/
|- presentation/
  |- pages/
  |- view/
  |- widgets/
|- utils/
|- main.dart
part/
  |- lib/
    |- config
    |- theme
.env/
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- core - It is the part of the business logic operations in the project.
2- l10n - It is the part where arb files are created for the multilanguage operation of the application.
3- presentation is the part where operations related to the user interface are performed.
4- util‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains the utilities/common functions of your application.
5- part - It was created to keep the fixed values in the project in a modular structure.
```
